SLSQP optimizer is a sequential least squares programming algorithm which uses the Han-Powell quasi-Newton method with a BFGS update of the B-matrix and an L1-test function in the step-length algorithm. The optimizer uses a slightly modified version of Lawson and Hansonâ€™s NNLS nonlinear least-squares solver.
